HydroSim Torque 3D v3.5.1 Fork
================

This is my fork of Torque3D for my online hydroplane racing simulator - HydroSim.

The HydroSim branch is currently my main development branch. It's based off 
of the main development branch with changes here and there.

Code has been merged from the following branches:
Hybrid netcode to prevent server warping control objects - https://github.com/JeffProgrammer/BeyondReality
PhysX 3 advanced - https://github.com/rextimmy/Torque3D/tree/physx3_advanced

HydroSim utilizes Triton Ocean SDK for water rendering/physics - http://sundog-soft.com/sds/features/ocean-and-water-rendering-with-triton/
